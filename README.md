WikiBot
=======

Python-based Reddit bot for easily linking users to Wikipedia pages and suggesting other articles and sub-reddits.

WikiBot uses PRAW(https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to parse and reply to Reddit comments and a wikipedia python
wrapper(https://github.com/goldsmith/Wikipedia) to get information from Wikipedia.
